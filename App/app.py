        st.write("""This application is designed to predict whether an employee is likely to stay or leave the company based on various input features. 
                    By analyzing key factors such as job satisfaction, last evaluation score, number of projects, average monthly hours worked, 
                    time spent in the company, and other relevant attributes, the model provides insights into employee attrition.

                    1. **Input Features**: You will be prompted to enter several details about the employee. This includes quantitative metrics like 
                    satisfaction level and last evaluation score, as well as categorical data such as the sales department and salary level.

                    2. **Data Processing**: Once you submit the information, the app will preprocess the data. This involves scaling numerical features 
                    to ensure they are on a similar scale and encoding categorical features to convert them into a format suitable for the model.

                    3. **Prediction**: After processing the input data, the app uses a trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of 
                    the employee leaving the company. The model has been trained on historical employee data and takes into account various 
                    factors that influence attrition.

                    4. **Results**: Finally, the app will display the prediction result, indicating whether the employee is likely to stay or leave. 
                    This information can help HR departments and managers make informed decisions regarding employee engagement and retention strategies.
